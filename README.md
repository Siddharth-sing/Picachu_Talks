# Project Setup
* I have used the VS code editor for this project. PyCharm is also equally recommended, it depends upon your personal choice which among the two to choose. But other than these two I won't strongly recommend any editor.

* Create a file `my_assistant.py`.

##Imports & Packages Installation
